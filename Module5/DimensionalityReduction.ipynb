    "## Dimensionality reduction with principal components\n",
    "\n",
    "**Principal component analysis**, or **PCA**, is an alternative to regularization and straight-forward feature elimination. PCA is particularly useful for problems with very large numbers of features compared to the number of training cases. For example, when faced with a problem with many thousands of features and perhaps a few thousand cases, PCA can be a good choice to **reduce the dimensionality** of the feature space.  \n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is one of a family of transformation methods that reduce dimensionality. PCA is the focus here, since it is the most widely used of these methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of PCA is rather simple: Find a linear transformation of the feature space which **projects the majority of the variance** onto a few orthogonal dimensions in the transformed space. The PCA transformation maps the data values to a new coordinate system defined by the principal components. Assuming the highest variance directions, or **components**, are the most informative, low variance components can be eliminated from the space with little loss of information. \n",
    "\n",
    "The projection along which the greatest variance occurs is called the **first principal component**. The next projection, orthogonal to the first, with the greatest variance is called the **second principal component**. Subsequent components are all mutually orthogonal with decreasing variance along the projected direction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Widely used PCA algorithms compute the components sequentially, starting with the first principal component. This means that it is computationally efficient to compute the first several components from a very large number of features. Thus, PCA can make problems with very large numbers of features computationally tractable. \n",
    "\n",
    "****\n",
    "**Note:** It may help your understanding to realize that principal components are a scaled version of the **eigenvectors** of the feature matrix. The scale for each dimensions is given by the **eigenvalues**. The eigenvalues are the fraction of the variance explained by the components. \n",
