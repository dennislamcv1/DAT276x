    "# Bagging and Random Forest Models\n",

    "Using **ensemble methods** can greatly improve the results achieved with weak machine learning algorithms, also called **weak learners**. Ensemble methods achieve better performance by aggregating the results of many statistically independent models. This process averages out the errors and produces a final better prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will work with a widely used ensemble method known as **bootstrap aggregating** or simply **bagging**. Bagging follows a simple procedure:\n",
    "1. N learners (machine learning models) are defined. \n",
    "2. N subsamples of the training data are created by **Bernoulli sampling with replacement**.\n",
    "3. The N learners are trained on the subsamples of the training data.\n",
    "4. The ensemble is scored by averaging, or taking a majority vote, of the predictions from the N learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classification and regression tree models** are most typically used with bagging methods. The most common such algorithm is know as the **random forest**. The random forest method is highly scalable and generally produces good results, even for complex problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Classification and regression trees tend to be robust to noise or outliers in the training data. This is true for the random forest algorithm as well. "
